\section{Results}\label{sec:METHODRESULTS}

%% here we will discuss results of our work. Consider and compare quality metrics, show interesting finding. E.g.g

Among xxx we found a strong positive correlation xxx. That means the xxx.
This can be explained by xxx.


With growth of vector dimensions share of edges falling into NSW graph cut is increasing and tend to reach 0.5.

Number of edges linearly growing to number of nodes. Thus, cut is linearly growing to nodes.
